Starting this summer, I will be a Rev. Howard J. McKenna CSC Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Notre Dame.

Currently, I am a math graduate student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
My research interests are in discrete isoperimetric inequalities, Hilbert functions, Macaulay theorems, lex ideals, and intersection results like the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem.
Jamie Radcliffe and Alexandra Seceleanu are my advisors.

My undergraduate years were spent at the University of Wisconsin-Superior.
I graduated in 2018 with a B.S. in mathematics and computer science.
Sergei Bezrukov and Steven Rosenberg had an enormous influence on my life during my stay there.

The animation below represents the lexicographic order in three dimensions.
Much of my work has centered around this order.
