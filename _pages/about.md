I am a math graduate student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
My research interests are in discrete isoperimetric inequalities, Macaulay-Lex theorems, Hilbert functions, lex ideals, and intersection results like the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem.
Jamie Radcliffe is my advisor.

You should check out some of my [papers](/papers/).
