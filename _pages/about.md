I am a Kenna Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Notre Dame.
My research interests are in Hilbert functions, Macaulay theorems, lex ideals, discrete isoperimetric problems, and intersection results like the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem.
At Notre Dame, I am mentored by Juan Migliore and David Galvin.

I finished my PhD at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2024.
Jamie Radcliffe and Alexandra Seceleanu were my advisors.
My undergraduate years were spent at the University of Wisconsin-Superior.
I graduated in 2018 with a B.S. in mathematics and computer science.
Sergei Bezrukov and Steven Rosenberg had an enormous influence on my life during my stay there.

The animation below represents the lexicographic order in three dimensions.
Much of my work has centered around this order.
